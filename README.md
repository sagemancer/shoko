# Shoko

Shoko is a "real-time audio" assessment program that converts verbal instructions to applicable actions within various video games. The focus of the project is to allow a user to reliably issue a command verbally and have an immediate response in the game. Ideally, I'd like to make this independant of any specific game (or provider, i.e. Steam) and focus more on quantity, however, this project is still in an infant state, so games will be included as the necessity arises or as times allows.
